Adventures on Qubes
===================

Idea
----

I collected some perceptions during my first steps on Qubes. Every single
topic i found out took time and this could be speeded up if others that did the
same just wrote down what they found out.

The Qubes wiki could be a location where this information could go but i doubt
ITL like everyone to tamper around with that documentation.

The posts in the various googlegroups could be a location as well. But all the
information in such huge message boards are unstructured, outdated or difficult
to consume.

So i adapted an idea of another project which has a collection of user configs
in a single repo, each user having a directory. The curator of that repo just
has to make sure the patches are only effecting the files in the users
directory and every user can provide whatever he thinks is useful.

Invite
------

So everone undertaking his first steps with Qubes is invited to participate in
this collection of structured and well groomed information. 

Rules
-----

- Clone this repo

- Create a directory and a markdown-file with the same name as you nick name in github

- Write a short description of yourself and your interests in Qubes

- Put a README.md, configs, scripts into the directory

- Create a branch and a PR
